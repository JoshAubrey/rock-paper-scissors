# rock-paper-scissors

A 5 round rock paper scissors game against the computer!

> ## From The Odin Project's [curriculum part 1](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors) & [part 2](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/dom-manipulation)

## Project Requirements

1. Create a blank HTML document with a link to an external .js file. This game is going to be played completely from the console to start with.
2. Begin with a function called computerPlay that will randomly return either ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or ‘Scissors’.
3. Write a function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors. The function should take two parameters - the playerSelection (case-insensitive) and computerSelection - and then return a string that declares the winner of the round.
4. Write a NEW function called game(). Use the previous function inside of this one to play a 5 round game that keeps score and reports a winner or loser at the end.
5. Refactor the scripts to give it a simple UI so that the player can play the game by clicking on buttons rather than typing their answer in a prompt using DOM manipulation and event listeners.
